                        Access to personal information: In some jurisdictions, you have the right to request access to your personal information. In these cases, we will comply, subject to any relevant legal requirements and exemptions, including identity verification procedures. Before providing data to you, we will ask for proof of identity and sufficient information about your interaction with us so that we can locate any relevant data. We may also charge you a fee for providing you with a copy of your data (except where this is not permissible under local law).

You may also have the right to request deletion of your personal information. Please note that such a request could be refused because your personal information is required to provide you with the products or services you requested, e.g. to deliver a product or send an invoice to your email address, or that it is required by the applicable law.

                        Do Not Track: Some web browsers (including Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Chrome) incorporate a “Do Not Track” (“DNT”) or similar feature that signals to websites that a user does not want to have his or her online activity and behavior tracked. If a website that responds to a particular DNT signal receives the DNT signal, the browser can block that website from collecting certain information about the browser’s user. Not all browsers offer a DNT option and DNT signals are not yet uniform. For this reason, many website operators, including FASHION³, do not respond to DNT signals.

                        If you are a resident of the state of California, this section addresses your rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”). Any terms defined in the CCPA have the same meaning when used in this Policy.

                    <p className={s.spacingOnlyTop}>
                        We may use or disclose the personal information we collect for one or more of the business purposes indicated in this Policy.

                    <p className={s.spacingOnlyTop}>

                        We may disclose your personal information to a third party for a business purpose. When we disclose personal information for a business purpose, we enter a contract that describes the purpose and requires the recipient to both keep that personal information confidential and not use it for any purpose except performing the contract. For more information on how we share personal information, including the categories of third-parties with which we share personal information, please see the “Does fashion³ share my personal information with anyone?” section above.

                        We do not sell personal information. In the event that we do sell any personal information, we will update this Policy to list the categories of consumers’ personal information sold.

                        To exercise the access, data portability, and deletion rights described above, please submit a verifiable consumer request to us by:
                    </p>
                    <p className={s.spacingOnlyTop}>
                        Sending us an e-mail at hello@fashion3.io
                    </p>
                    <p className={s.spacingOnlyTop}>
                        Only you, or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information. You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child.
                    </p>
                    <p className={s.spacingOnlyTop}>
                        You may only make such a request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer request must provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative, and describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.
                    </p>
                    <p className={s.spacingOnlyTop}>
                        We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you. Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.
                    </p>
                    <p className={s.spacingOnlyTop}>
                        We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt. If we require more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. We will deliver our written response electronically. Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request’s receipt. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.

If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.
