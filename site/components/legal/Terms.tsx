          <span className={s.spacingRight}>12.6</span>If you choose a direct
          payment gateway to complete your purchase, then Shopify Inc. stores
          your credit card data. It is encrypted through the Payment Card
          Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS). Your purchase transaction
          data is stored only as long as is necessary to complete your purchase
          transaction. After that is complete, your purchase transaction
          information is deleted. All direct payment gateways adhere to the
          standards set by PCI-DSS as managed by the PCI Security Standards
          Council, which is a joint effort of brands like Visa, Mastercard,
          American Express and Discover. PCI-DSS requirements help ensure the
